# PBCyE_CblC

This folder contains the information regarding molecular dynamics simulations (MD) of human CblC (doi:).

Parameters for 5'-deoxy-5'-adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) are present in the AdoCbl folder. 

MD folder contains the simulated trajectories, for both, apo-CblC and AdoCbl-CblC wild type systems and C149 mutants. The files containing _nowat in the names represent 1000 frames trajectories of each system without solvent or ions. The files containing _short in the names represents 100 frames trajectories in the presence of solvent. Both files types are summaries of 1 microsecond long MDs. Each folder also containts PDB files as topology models.
